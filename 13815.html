        <b>Difference between Act and Regulations:</b><br>
        An <b>Act</b> is a legal document providing a general or broad description of legal policies.<br><br>

        <b>Regulations</b> are guidelines associated with an Act that guide how provisions of an Act are applied and should be followed.
       <br><br>
      <b>Difference between Legislation and Regulation:</b><br>
       <b>Legislation</b> is law passed by a legislative body.<br>
<b>Regulation</b> is a set of rules or guidelines issued by an executive body such as government agencies or regulatory boards in compliance with the law. 
<br><br>
•	Parliaments pass laws. They are called legislation. <br>
•	Then government regulators have to enforce the law. They look at the law and work out the nitty-gritty details that need to be followed in order for the law to be followed.
